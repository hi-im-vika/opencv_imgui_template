# opencv-imgui-template

This is a template project I use for my personal projects. A list of places I borrowed stuff from follows below, excluding OpenCV and ImGui.

The template is multithreaded and uses two threads for updating program logic and the GUI.

This was only tested on macOS; compatibility with other platforms is unknown.
